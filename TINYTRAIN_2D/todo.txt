TODO:
- camera focused on end of the track instead of the train (+rotation)
- smooth camera movement
- add obstacles to loose the game
- add target zones to win the game
- add further gamestates (mainmenu, pause, win/loose screen)
- add optional targets to score more points/objectives (passengers)


DONE:
- implement circular catmul rom spline to prevent self intersections ect. (see http://www.cemyuksel.com/research/catmullrom_param/catmullrom.pdf, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9489736/catmull-rom-curve-with-no-cusps-and-no-self-intersections/)
- add spline class for smooth railtracks
	c1 continuity, local control, interpolation: catmull rom, bezier, herminte
- new track segment is not streched to full length now because the min/max thingy doesnt work as intended
	- THIS MAY EVEN BE A FEATURE?! try when spline is done
- extend track by input
