TODO:
- add spline class for smooth railtracks
- camera focused on end of the track instead of the train (+rotation)
- smooth camera movement


DONE:
- extend track by input
- new track segment is not streched to full length now because the min/max thingy doesnt work as intended
	- THIS MAY EVEN BE A FEATURE?! try when spline is done
