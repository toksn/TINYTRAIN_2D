# TINYTRAIN_2D

little train game written in c++ with the help of SFML for graphics and tinyheaders for maths and collision.

!work in progress!

The Solution is for msvs2017. should work on older compilers as well as long as unique_ptr, auto and the likes are supported (C++11)
SFML 2.4.2 but every SFML2 version should work at the moment. 

may include the SFML and tinyheaders files as submodules in the future.
