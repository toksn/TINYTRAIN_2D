# TINYTRAIN_2D

little train game written in c++ with the help of SFML for graphics and tinyheaders for maths and collision.

!work in progress!

Currently using msvc2015. should work others compilers as long as c++ features are supported (unique_ptr, auto and the likes)
SFML 2.4.2 but every SFML2 version should work at the moment.
